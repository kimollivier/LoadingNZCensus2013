# LoadingNZCensus2013
Sample python tools to load and map the NZ Census 2013
The NZ census is (was?) available as a series or spreadsheets or a CSV dump.
My challenge was to build a loader that created a database of tables 
that could be used in a GIS to view any of the 1500 variables on a map to look at 
the distribution of the counts
This set of tools can load the CSV into sqlite or a file geodatabase
Another tool can create a heatmap in ArcMap for any variable
